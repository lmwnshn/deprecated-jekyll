## Question

**Question about the order of output in an example**

```
package main

import "fmt"

func sum(s []int, c chan int) {
   sum := 0
   for _, v := range s {
      sum += v
   }
   c <- sum
}

func main() {
   s := []int{7, 2, 8, -9, 4, 0}

   c := make(chan int)
   go sum(s[:len(s)/2], c)
   go sum(s[len(s)/2:], c)
   x, y := <-c, <-c

   fmt.Println(x, y, x+y)
}
```

The output is -5 17 12, why is -5 ahead of 17?

I thought the order should be random, because the order of calculating 2 threads could be different

## Answer

My understanding is that they are in fact random. Just that for some reason or other, the go example server tends to return -5 17 12.

If you import time and sleep at the start of the sum function,

```time.Sleep(1 * time.Nanosecond)```

you should see 17 -5 12 appear sometimes.

In general, I believe there are no ordering guarantees for calling goroutines in this way.

Everything that happens on a computer has a reason.

I wouldn't advise being clever [0], which is the only reason I can think of that you might need an answer that isn't simply "they're random". But if you're interested, to my knowledge, and feel free to correct me:

1. Go uses a cooperative scheduler [1,2]. As of the current runtime, it mainly (only?) preempts on function calls [3]. You're just doing math, so it won't preempt. But on the playground and by default on older versions of Go, GOMAXPROCS=1 [4].

2. Just read the scheduler source [5]. Maybe the scheduler design doc too [6]. You're interested in runqput. Trace through the code. I'm relatively sure next is true, so you end up using the runnext slot. So the last thing scheduled runs first.

3. I don't know why you'd want to when the source is available, but you can also just trace the scheduler [7].

Good enough reason?

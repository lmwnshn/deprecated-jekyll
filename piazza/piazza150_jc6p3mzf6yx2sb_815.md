## Question

Omitted, homework-specific.

This was posted for a general "is this CPS" question.

## Followup

If it helps to think about CPS, I like drawing a "where does the computer go" picture.

In CPS: only forward! never back!

Draw out how your function is going and if your arrows are all pointing forward you're probably fine, CPS-wise.

Hi! I'm Wan. I believe that I'm the first (and only) Bruneian undergraduate at CMU.

## Interests

I like systems programming, distributed systems and databases in particular. I'm generally interested in the tradeoffs that people make between speed, memory, formalism, and communication.

I can probably still throw buzzwords around, but I'm now very far removed from the Python3 bandwagon and the Python data science hype train. I would like to get back into cybersecurity, but time is an issue and I'm probably not looking to make a career out of that - cheeky [monkey patching](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/woot13/woot13-kholia.pdf) or [timing attacks](https://sirdarckcat.blogspot.com/2019/03/http-cache-cross-site-leaks.html) are always worth reading though.

I'm interested in learning more about randomized algorithms and approximation algorithms, with a focus on how they can be implemented and used in systems building. I feel that randomness is a promising resource that hasn't been utilized enough, and I'm encouraged by things like [MESH](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.04738.pdf) popping up nowadays. I'm looking for a study group to bounce ideas off and to keep me accountable for one of the standard texts (Mitzenmacher, Motwani, etc), with the caveat that I'm a pretty slow learner and like dwelling on things.

## Hobbies

I play vanishingly less DOTA2 and League nowadays, and my rank in both has declined accordingly.

I enjoy creating teaching material, usually aimed at an introductory level. I particularly believe that everyone should have access to good learning resources, and whether they want to make use of it is then up to them.

I spend the rest of my time sleeping, reading about food, or browsing cute subreddits.

## Stuck Projects

- [2015] Falls are the leading cause of injuries (fatal and otherwise) for older people. I've envisioned a cheap wearable everyday fall-arresting device, targeted towards the elderly and infirm. I haven't been able to come up with a reasonable concept, though, and it's definitely a hardware problem - not my forte. Dumb ideas have included weight shifting clothing, quick inflating swarm quadcopters, and airbag-esque pockets. You could also repurpose something like ReWalk, presumably, but that's way too expensive.

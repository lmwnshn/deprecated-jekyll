title: Course Reviews @ CMU

☆: courses which I thought were worth attending CMU for. A course without them might still be good. Opinions are free if you want them.

Semester difficulty ratings: {light, medium, heavy, death} corresponding to {lots of free time, routine, strict routine and some all nighters, regular all nighters}. I generally aim for medium to heavy semesters.

Context: I entered CMU with decent programming background and meh math background. I'm generally better at systems than theory. I strongly prefer reading ahead.

Format of (Grade Obtained, Star Rating, Course).

## Fall 2019

- TA 15-445
- **A** 15-418 Parallel Computer Architecture and Programming
- **B** 15-455 Undergraduate Complexity Theory
- **B** ☆☆ 15-857 Analytical Performance Modeling
- **A** ☆☆ 15-859 Algorithms for Big Data

Dropped: 15-462, 21-301 \\
Other commitments: database group \\
Overall: death

Note: I think 418 is a good first or second systems course. It is not so good as a fourth. UCT is very well-taught and tries to incorporate newer results, which is very neat. I just found 857 and 859 much more interesting to sink time into, and the BusTub was often on fire.
